* There is a double write after a wait?!
	If the wait has not had a zero output before then the data after the wait is output again



* Need to find what is keeping the data file open each time



* At the moment inside DsimModel.cpp there is untested logic for "mTryGetData" and when to respond to a successful wait waitingForInput() by getting the next data value



* Add defines, simple key value replacement
	* #string value




* Test the write held times using specific input timing data
