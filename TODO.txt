* Moved from: BombJack\TODO.txt
	* TODO: Will need a replacement for the Proteus data generators because they have a 1024 byte limit
		Something better like the display part will do.
			Will need substantial outputs, and something to make it easier to output the address, with auto increment and _MEWR signals
			EBS 8 bits, address 16 bits (in effect 24 bits address, might as well make it 32 bits) data 8 bits, plus _MEWR signal
			Include binary chunks from data files, like the ROM dumps, no more editing hex values for binary image data



* Read a digital data definition file, emit digital data
	Done: Output the next 0-31 bit range
	$00000000

	TODO: Output the specified bit range from a file, for the whole file
	<0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,<..\foo\bar.bin

	TODO: Output the specified bit range from a file, from the start byte offset in the file, for the whole file
	<0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,@$123,<..\foo\bar.bin

	TODO: Output the specified bit range from a file, from the start byte offset in the file, for number of bytes
	<0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,@$123,>$123,<..\foo\bar.bin


* Need bits counting syntax
	TODO: Add 1 to the bits
	+8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23



* Need wait for negative edge
	TODO: Wait for positive edge on the input bits for the specified bits
	^0,3,5
