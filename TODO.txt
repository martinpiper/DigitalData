* Moved from: BombJack\TODO.txt
	* TODO: Will need a replacement for the Proteus data generators because they have a 1024 byte limit
		Something better like the display part will do.
			Will need substantial outputs, and something to make it easier to output the address, with auto increment and _MEWR signals
			EBS 8 bits, address 16 bits (in effect 24 bits address, might as well make it 32 bits) data 8 bits, plus _MEWR signal
			Include binary chunks from data files, like the ROM dumps, no more editing hex values for binary image data



* Need wait for negative edge
	TODO: Wait for negative edge on any of the specified input bits
	^0,3,5
