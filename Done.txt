* Don't forget the build needs to be x86 not x64 :D



* Time for low memwrite and high memwrite transition is needed



* Don't need such a longlarge display for the device



* Read a digital data definition file, emit digital data
	Done: Output the next 0-31 bit range
	d$00000000

	Done: Output the specified bit range from a file, for the whole file
	<0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,<..\foo\bar.bin

	Done: Output the specified bit range from a file, from the start byte offset in the file, for the whole file. Data in the file must be aligned to 8 bits, a byte.
	<0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,@$123,<..\foo\bar.bin

	Done: Output the specified bit range from a file, from the start byte offset in the file, for number of bytes. Data in the file must be aligned to 8 bits, a byte.
	<0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,@$123,>$123,<..\foo\bar.bin
